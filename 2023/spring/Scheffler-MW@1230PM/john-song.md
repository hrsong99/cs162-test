## John Song: A short introduction

What to say. My Korean name is Harim Song, but I go by John. I've lived in quite a few countries, such as:
1. South Africa
2. South Korea
3. The United States
4. India
5. Germany
6. Argentina
7. Taiwan

Not ***all*** of these countries are due to Minerva, though. I lived in **South Africa** for the first ten years of my life (from when I was three), before I moved to **Oklahoma, USA** when I was twelve until I graduated high school. Then came Minerva and a lot of luggage-packing. This reminds me of a quote by Mark Twain, I believe, which went something like this:

> *I like long walks, especially when taken by those who annoy me*

Considering how much I've been flying around, perhaps there are people who find me annoying? Well anyways, that's done.
